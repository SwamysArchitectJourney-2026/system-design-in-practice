# Content Rules (System Design in Practice)

**Version**: 1.1  
**Last Updated**: December 2025  
**Priority**: MANDATORY - All content creation must follow these rules without exception

---

## 📋 Rule Applicability

**IMPORTANT**: These rules apply differently based on content type:

### Case Study Documentation (`src/07_case-studies/` directory)
- ✅ **File naming**: Standard naming conventions (requirements.md, high-level-design.md, etc.)
- ✅ **Line limits**: Recommended ≤150 lines, but flexible for comprehensive documentation
- ⚠️ **YAML frontmatter**: NOT required (case study files are documentation)
- ✅ **Zero-copy policy**: Applies (content must be original)
- ✅ **File references**: Must point to existing files
- ✅ **Diagrams**: Co-located in `diagrams/` folder within each case study

### Educational Content (`src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, `src/08_failures/`)
- ✅ **File naming**: Must follow numbering conventions (01_, 02_, etc., no 00_)
- ✅ **Line limits**: Recommended ≤150 lines (split, don't trim)
- ✅ **YAML frontmatter**: Recommended for content files (all 5 metadata fields when content is added)
- ✅ **Zero-copy policy**: Applies (content must be transformative)
- ✅ **File references**: Must point to existing files

### Case Studies (`src/07_case-studies/` directory)
- ✅ **File naming**: Standard naming conventions (no numbering required for case study folders)
- ✅ **Structure**: Each case study follows standard structure (requirements, HLD, LLD, scalability, trade-offs)
- ✅ **Diagrams**: Co-located in `diagrams/` folder within each case study
- ⚠️ **YAML frontmatter**: NOT required (case study documentation)
- ✅ **Content quality**: Must follow zero-copy policy

### References (`src/references/` directory)
- ✅ **File naming**: Logical names (books.md, papers.md, tools.md)
- ⚠️ **Numbering**: NOT required (reference materials)
- ⚠️ **YAML frontmatter**: NOT required

---

## 🚫 Zero-Copy Policy (Non-Negotiable)

**CRITICAL**: All content (case study documentation and educational content) must be transformative, not reformative.

❌ **NEVER** copy text verbatim from books, articles, websites, videos, or third-party materials  
❌ **NEVER** mirror a source's outline, section order, headings, or example sequence  
❌ **NEVER** use "light paraphrasing" — must transform completely  
✅ **ALWAYS** create diagrams in Mermaid-first style with ASCII fallback (never embed copyrighted figures)  
✅ **ALWAYS** write fresh, minimal code from first principles  
✅ Brief quotations allowed ONLY with quotation marks and source citation

---

## 🔄 Transformative Workflow (Required Every Time)

**Step-by-step process for creating original educational content**:

1. **Source Intake**: Skim for intent and big ideas; don't copy notes verbatim
2. **Concept Map**: Create fresh outline with different sectioning tailored to System Design in Practice
3. **Teach Differently**: Use new analogies, scenarios, datasets, use-cases (avoid source examples)
4. **Produce Original Artifacts**: Explanations, Mermaid diagrams (with ASCII fallback), minimal examples
5. **Cross-Link**: Add references and connections across system design sections
6. **Similarity Audit**: Ensure no sentences/structures resemble source
7. **Optional References**: Add "References/Inspired by" links (no copied phrasing)

**Goal**: Create transformative educational content, not just reformative. Entirely new presentation, examples, and explanations that teach the same concepts through original methods.

---

## ⏱️ 25-Minute Learning Segments

**APPLICABILITY**: This rule applies to educational content files (`src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, `src/08_failures/`).

**For Case Study Documentation**: The 150-line limit is a **recommendation**, not a strict requirement. Case study files may exceed 150 lines if needed for comprehensive documentation.

✅ **Modular content** designed for focused 25-minute sessions  
✅ **Multi-Part Structure**: Complex topics split into Part 1, Part 2, ... Part N  
✅ **One-Shot Learning**: Each segment complete and actionable within time limit  
✅ **Target Length**: 150 lines of content maximum per response (educational content)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Splitting vs. Trimming Policy

**APPLICABILITY**: This rule applies to educational content files (`src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, `src/08_failures/`).

**For Case Study Documentation**: If case study files exceed 150 lines, consider splitting for better organization, but it's not mandatory.

**MANDATORY APPROACH** (Educational Content Only): When content exceeds 150 lines, **ALWAYS SPLIT** into multiple parts. **NEVER TRIM** or condense content.

**Why Splitting is Required:**
- ✅ **Preserves ALL educational content** - No loss of examples, explanations, or concepts
- ✅ **Maintains learning value** - Each part remains complete and actionable
- ✅ **Better learning experience** - Learners get comprehensive coverage across parts
- ✅ **Follows 25-minute principle** - Each part fits within focused learning session

**Why Trimming is Prohibited:**
- ❌ **Loses educational content** - Examples, explanations, or concepts may be removed
- ❌ **Reduces learning value** - Condensed content may miss important details
- ❌ **Violates zero-copy policy** - If source had comprehensive content, we should preserve it
- ❌ **Poor learning experience** - Learners miss important information

**Splitting Process:**
1. **Identify logical breakpoints** - Split at natural topic boundaries (e.g., "Foundation" → "Implementation" → "Advanced")
2. **Preserve all content** - Move content to appropriate part, don't delete
3. **Maintain completeness** - Each part should be self-contained and complete
4. **Use proper naming** - Follow naming convention: `Part1-A.md`, `Part1-B.md`, etc.
5. **Update references** - Update all file references after splitting

**Example**: If a file has 300 lines covering "Factory Pattern Fundamentals" and "Factory Pattern Advanced", split into:
- `01_Factory-Pattern-Part1-A.md` (Fundamentals - 150 lines)
- `01_Factory-Pattern-Part1-B.md` (Advanced - 150 lines)

**NOT**: Condense to 150 lines by removing examples or explanations.

---

## 📋 Required Content Structure

### 5 Required Metadata Fields (Educational Content Only)

**APPLICABILITY**: These metadata fields are RECOMMENDED for educational content files in `src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, and `src/08_failures/` directories (when content is added).

**NOT REQUIRED** for:
- Case study files (`src/07_case-studies/` directory)
- Code examples (`src/` directory)
- Infrastructure documentation (`infra/` directory)
- General documentation (`docs/` directory)

Every educational content file MUST include:

```yaml
---
learning_level: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced"
prerequisites: ["required knowledge", "prior concepts"]
estimated_time: "25 minutes"  # Standard, adjust if needed
learning_objectives:
  - "Specific, measurable outcome 1"
  - "Specific, measurable outcome 2"
related_topics:
  prerequisites: ["../prerequisite-content/"]
  builds_upon: ["../foundational-content/"]
  enables: ["../advanced-content/"]
  cross_refs: ["../related-domains/"]
---
```

### Numbering Convention

✅ **ALWAYS** use zero-padded numeric prefixes starting at `01_`  
❌ **NEVER** use `00_` prefixes - **NO EXCEPTIONS**  
✅ Keep numbering stable; add new numbers rather than renumbering widely  
✅ Use hyphens for multi-word names: `01_Software-Design-Principles/`

**CRITICAL**: This rule applies to **ALL files** in the repository:
- ✅ Educational content files (`src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, etc.)
- ✅ Documentation files (`docs/`)
- ✅ Any numbered files anywhere in the repository
- ❌ **NO EXCEPTIONS** - `00_` is NEVER allowed, even for meta/documentation files

**Why This Rule Exists**:
- Maintains consistent numbering across the repository
- Prevents confusion about file ordering
- Ensures predictable file organization
- `01_` clearly indicates the first item, `00_` is ambiguous

### Learning Order Requirements (CRITICAL)

**CRITICAL**: File numbering MUST reflect logical learning dependencies, not arbitrary ordering.

**Standard System Design Learning Progression** (src/01_introduction/ → src/08_failures/):

1. **01_introduction**: Getting started with system design
2. **02_interview-prep**: Interview preparation strategies
3. **03_foundations**: Foundational concepts (abstractions, consistency, failures)
4. **04_principles**: System design principles (availability, scalability, etc.)
5. **05_building-blocks**: Core building blocks (DNS, load balancers, databases, etc.)
6. **06_patterns**: Architectural patterns (caching, rate limiting, CQRS, etc.)
7. **07_case-studies**: End-to-end case studies
8. **08_failures**: Real-world failure analysis

**Why This Order Matters**:

- Foundations (03) must come before principles (04) - learners need basic concepts first
- Principles (04) must come before building blocks (05) - understand principles before implementation
- Building blocks (05) must come before patterns (06) - patterns build upon blocks
- Case studies (07) come after patterns - apply knowledge to real systems
- Failures (08) come last - learn from real-world mistakes

**When Creating New Content**:

- ✅ Verify prerequisites are numbered BEFORE the new content
- ✅ Check that "enables" relationships point to content numbered AFTER
- ✅ Ensure learning dependencies match file numbering order
- ❌ NEVER place content that depends on later-numbered files

### File Naming Convention for Split Files

**CRITICAL**: When files are split into multiple parts, use `-part1`, `-part2` pattern (not `Part1-A`, `Part1-B`).

**Current Repository Pattern**:

- ✅ `02_network-abstractions-part1.md`
- ✅ `02_network-abstractions-part2.md`
- ✅ `03_consistency-models-part1.md`
- ✅ `03_consistency-models-part2.md`

**Rules**:
1. ✅ **Use `-part1`, `-part2` suffixes** - Preserves base slug for predictable links
2. ✅ **Keep the numbered prefix** - Maintains learning sequence (e.g., `02_network-abstractions-part1.md`)
3. ✅ **Avoid letter suffixes** - Don't use `Part1-A`, `Part1-B` patterns
4. ✅ **Maintain order** - Parts reflect sequential content flow

**When to Use This Pattern**:
- Content exceeds 150 lines
- Cannot be split into distinct semantic concepts
- Content is a single cohesive topic that must be split mechanically

**For Better Approaches**: See [File Naming Conventions](../.cursor/rules/07_file-naming-conventions.mdc) for semantic naming patterns and decision framework.

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner, more readable file names
- Easier to understand part relationships
- Maintains file reference stability
- Better than `Part1-A`, `Part1-B` patterns

---

## 🎓 Educational Excellence Standards

All content must demonstrate:

- ✅ **Clear objectives and outcomes**: Specific, measurable learning goals
- ✅ **Progressive scaffolding**: Foundations → Practice → Pitfalls → Next Steps
- ✅ **Original examples, datasets, and exercises**: Never reuse source examples
- ✅ **Mermaid-first visuals**: Primary Mermaid diagrams with ASCII fallback for compatibility
- ✅ **Cross-references across tracks**: Development, AI/ML, Data Science, DevOps

---

## ✅ Quality Gate Questions (Before Publishing)

**Self-check before finalizing any educational content**:

1. ✅ Is this explanation clearer than the source material?
2. ✅ Does this fit naturally in the learning progression?
3. ✅ Would a learner understand this without the original source?
4. ✅ Are the examples relevant and practical?
5. ✅ Does this content add educational value beyond the reference?
6. ✅ Is this content within 150 lines for effective delivery?

---

## 📁 Content Placement Policy

✅ `src/` folders are EXCLUSIVELY for learning content  
❌ Never mix planning materials, workflow docs, or meta content  
✅ Group logically by learning progression (01_introduction → 08_failures)  
✅ Place content in correct numbered folder based on learning path

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Code Examples Policy

**This repository is EXCLUSIVELY for educational content. Code implementations are in separate repositories.**

**Code Examples in Educational Content:**

- ✅ **Minimal, Illustrative Snippets**: Code examples should be minimal and focused on teaching concepts
- ✅ **Teaching-Focused**: Code should demonstrate principles, patterns, or concepts, not provide complete implementations
- ✅ **Reference Full Code**: Link to full implementations in separate code repositories (Python, CSharp, JavaScript, etc.)
- ❌ **NO Full Implementations**: Do not include complete, runnable code projects in this repository
- ❌ **NO Production Code**: Do not include production-ready, deployable code in educational content
- ❌ **NO Code Repositories**: All full code implementations belong in separate GitHub repositories within the organization

**When Creating Code Examples:**

1. **Keep it minimal**: Show only the essential code needed to illustrate the concept
2. **Add comments**: Explain what the code demonstrates
3. **Link to full code**: Reference the separate code repository where full implementation exists
4. **Focus on learning**: Code should teach, not provide complete solutions

**Example Structure:**

```markdown
## Factory Pattern Example

Here's a minimal example demonstrating the Factory Pattern:

```python
# Minimal illustrative example
class ProductFactory:
    def create_product(self, product_type):
        if product_type == "A":
            return ProductA()
        return ProductB()
```

> **Full Implementation**: See complete code examples in the `src/` directory
```

### Source Materials Staging Area

**Location**: `source-materials/` (at repository root, git-ignored)

**Purpose**: **Staging folder for migration** - Temporary staging area where source content is placed before review and transformation into educational content.

**Critical Workflow**:

1. **Place materials**: User places source materials (transcripts, notes, documents) in `source-materials/` folder
2. **Review and migrate**: AI assistant reviews content, identifies unique topics, and migrates/transforms following Educational Content Rules
3. **Verify migration**: Confirm all unique content has been migrated to appropriate `src/` folders
4. **Keep source files**: After successful migration, keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually

**Important Notes**:

- ⚠️ **Files in `source-materials/` are NOT required to be compliant** - this is a staging area for raw source content
- ❌ **NEVER MODIFY files in `source-materials/`** - AI assistants must ONLY READ these files for migration purposes, never edit, format, or change them
- ✅ **Review rules apply DURING transformation** - ensure transformation process follows all Educational Content Rules
- ✅ **When user requests migration**: Review ALL files in `source-materials/`, identify unique content, and migrate following Educational Content Rules
- ✅ Files here will be transformed following Educational Content Rules into compliant content
- ✅ After transformation, create compliant content in `Reference/` or `Learning/`
- ✅ **After successful migration**: Keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually
- ❌ **Never commit `source-materials/` content** - it's git-ignored for a reason
- ✅ **Keep `source-materials/` folder** - it's a permanent staging area for future migrations

**Transformation Workflow** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

**🚨 CRITICAL**: This workflow uses **THE EXACT SAME 7-CATEGORY REVIEW CHECKLIST** as the Comprehensive Content Review Process. Every file created during migration MUST pass all review checks before being considered complete.

1. **OBSERVE**: Place source materials (transcripts, notes, etc.) in `source-materials/` (at repository root)
   - Scan and catalog source content
   - Identify key concepts and learning objectives
   - Understand source structure and dependencies

2. **ANALYZE**: Apply review rules DURING transformation using CoT/ReAct methodology:
   - **Reason through transformation**: Break down source content into logical learning segments
   - **Apply 7-category review checklist while transforming**:
     - Verify YAML frontmatter structure as you create it
     - Ensure content is transformative (not copied) during transformation
     - **Check line count as you build content (≤ 150 lines) - SPLIT if exceeds, NEVER TRIM**
     - Validate file naming conventions during creation
     - Verify file references as you add them
     - Ensure zero-copy policy compliance during transformation
     - Confirm learning progression logic as you structure content
     - **Preserve ALL educational content through splitting, not condensing**
   - **Use Chain-of-Thought**: Think through each transformation step explicitly
   - **Apply Reasoning**: Make logical decisions about content structure, examples, and explanations

3. **REASON**: Create new educational content in appropriate `src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, or `src/08_failures/` folders
   - Apply logical reasoning to determine correct placement
   - Ensure learning dependencies are properly structured
   - Verify content flow and progression

4. **VERIFY**: Review final content using comprehensive review checklist before committing
   - Cross-check all requirements
   - Validate compliance with all rules
   - Confirm zero-copy policy adherence
   - **Create migration verification report** in `docs/review-reports/` with date-based naming (e.g., `24Nov2025.md`)

5. **ACT**: After successful migration and verification:
   - Keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually
   - Save migration verification report to `docs/review-reports/` with date-based filename

**Compliance Requirements**:
- ❌ `source-materials/` files: **NO compliance required** (staging area - raw source content)
- ✅ **Transformation process**: **MUST follow review rules** (apply checklist during transformation)
- ✅ `src/01_introduction/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `src/02_interview-prep/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `src/03_foundations/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `src/04_principles/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `src/05_building-blocks/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `src/06_patterns/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `src/08_failures/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)

**Review During Migration** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

- **OBSERVE**: Systematically analyze source content before transformation
- **ANALYZE**: Apply the 7-category Individual File Review Checklist **while transforming** content
  - Use Chain-of-Thought to break down transformation into logical steps
  - Apply ReAct methodology: Observe → Analyze → Reason → Verify → Act
  - Use systematic reasoning to make transformation decisions
- **REASON**: Make logical decisions about:
  - Content structure and organization
  - Example selection and creation
  - Learning progression and dependencies
  - File naming and references
- **VERIFY**: Don't wait until after migration - catch issues during the transformation process
  - Verify compliance at each step: YAML structure, line count, naming, references, zero-copy policy
  - Cross-check findings as you transform
- **ACT**: Final review after migration confirms all requirements are met

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist (YAML Frontmatter, Content Structure, File Naming, File References, Content Quality, Zero-Copy Policy, Learning Progression) MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. The same CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning methodology used for reviews MUST be applied during migration/transformation.

### Learning Paths Creation Policy

**Note**: The repository structure is already established with numbered folders (`01_introduction/` through `08_failures/`). Content should be added progressively following Educational Content Rules.

---

## 🔗 File Reference Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Practices

**CRITICAL**: All file references MUST point to existing files or be clearly marked as planned content.

### When Creating File References

1. ✅ **Verify file exists** before adding reference
2. ✅ **Use exact file names** - match actual file names exactly (including all part suffixes)
3. ✅ **Test references** - run `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` after adding references
4. ✅ **Update after splitting** - when splitting files, update ALL references to that file immediately

### When Splitting Files

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**:

1. Create new part files
2. **IMMEDIATELY** run: `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` to find all references
3. Update ALL references to point to correct part files
4. Run validation again to verify
5. Test navigation manually

### Reference Patterns

- **Prerequisites/Builds Upon**: Use first part (`-Part1-Part1.md`) or specific part if needed
- **Enables**: Can reference any part, typically next part in sequence
- **Planned Content**: References to files that don't exist yet are acceptable IF clearly marked as planned

### Validation Checklist

Before committing:
- [ ] Run `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1`
- [ ] All references point to existing files (or are clearly planned)
- [ ] Navigation links work in markdown preview
- [ ] No broken references remain

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation Content Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: All interview preparation content in `src/02_interview-prep/` must be **generic and company-agnostic**.

### Generic Content Policy

❌ **NEVER** include company-specific names (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, etc.)  
❌ **NEVER** reference company-specific frameworks by name (e.g., "Amazon Leadership Principles")  
❌ **NEVER** create company-specific interview scripts or answers  
✅ **ALWAYS** use generic descriptions (e.g., "Leadership Principles", "Clarity–Energy–Success model")  
✅ **ALWAYS** frame content for broad applicability across organizations  
✅ **ALWAYS** focus on universal principles and practices  

**Rationale**: Interview prep content should be applicable to any organization, not tied to specific companies. This makes the content more valuable and reusable.

**Examples of Generic Framing**:
- ❌ "Amazon Leadership Principles" → ✅ "Leadership Principles (ownership, customer focus, bias for action)"
- ❌ "Microsoft's Clarity–Energy–Success model" → ✅ "Clarity–Energy–Success model (bringing clarity, energizing teams, driving success)"
- ❌ "For Amazon, AWS roles" → ✅ "For high-pressure TPM roles, customer-obsessed organizations"
- ❌ "For Google, Meta, Stripe, Uber" → ✅ "For deep-tech companies, innovation-focused organizations"

**When Creating Interview Prep Content**:
1. Focus on universal principles and practices
2. Use generic organizational types (product companies, startups, enterprise organizations)
3. Reference frameworks by their concepts, not company names
4. Make content applicable to any similar organization

---

## 🔍 Comprehensive Content Review Process

**APPLICABILITY**: This review process applies to educational content files (`src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, `src/08_failures/`).

**For Case Study Documentation**: Review for content quality, accuracy, and consistency, but YAML frontmatter and strict line limits are not required.

**MANDATORY**: All content in `src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, and `src/08_failures/` folders must undergo comprehensive review using CoT (Chain-of-Thought), ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), and systematic reasoning.

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. This ensures all content is compliant from the moment it's created.

### Review Request Protocol

**When a review is REQUESTED**:

- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Review EACH AND EVERY file individually - no file should be skipped
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Open and examine every file in the specified scope
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Apply the 7-category review checklist to every single file
- ❌ **NEVER**: Skip files, assume compliance, or review only a sample
- ❌ **NEVER**: Review only files that "look problematic" - review ALL files

**Scope of Review**:
- If reviewing `src/01_introduction/` folder: Review ALL files in `src/01_introduction/`
- If reviewing `src/02_interview-prep/` folder: Review ALL files in `src/02_interview-prep/`
- If reviewing `src/03_foundations/` folder: Review ALL files in `src/03_foundations/`
- If reviewing `src/04_principles/` folder: Review ALL files in `src/04_principles/`
- If reviewing `src/05_building-blocks/` folder: Review ALL files in `src/05_building-blocks/`
- If reviewing `src/06_patterns/` folder: Review ALL files in `src/06_patterns/`
- If reviewing `src/08_failures/` folder: Review ALL files in `src/08_failures/`
- If reviewing a specific subfolder: Review ALL files in that subfolder
- If reviewing specific files: Review each requested file individually

### Review Methodology

**Use CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning for every review**:

1. **OBSERVE**: Systematically scan and catalog all files
   - List every file in the review scope
   - No file should be excluded or skipped
2. **ANALYZE**: Review each file individually with deep analysis
   - Open and examine every file
   - Apply review checklist to each file
3. **REASON**: Apply logical reasoning to identify issues and patterns
4. **VERIFY**: Cross-check findings and validate compliance
5. **ACT**: Document findings and update content as needed

### Individual File Review Checklist

### Deep Dive Review Process

**When performing comprehensive review**:

1. **Systematic File Scanning**
   ```powershell
   # Get all files to review
   Get-ChildItem "src\01_introduction" -Recurse -Filter "*.md" | 
       Where-Object { $_.Name -ne "README.md" }
   ```

2. **Individual File Analysis**
   - Open each file
   - Check YAML frontmatter structure
   - Verify all metadata fields
   - Count lines (must be ≤ 150)
   - Check file naming conventions
   - Validate all file references
   - Review content quality indicators

3. **Reference Validation**
   ```powershell
   # Run reference validation
   .\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1
   ```

4. **Content Quality Analysis**
   - Check for code examples
   - Check for diagrams (Mermaid/ASCII)
   - Check for headings
   - Check for suspicious patterns
   - Verify zero-copy compliance

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all findings
   - Create issue list with file paths
   - Prioritize issues (critical vs. warnings)
   - Track fixes and verification

### Review Tools

**Use these tools for comprehensive review**:

- `.\tools\psscripts\Comprehensive-ReferenceReview.ps1` - Deep dive review with CoT/ReAct methodology
- `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` - File reference validation
- `.\tools\psscripts\Review-EducationalContent.ps1` - General compliance review

### Review Frequency

- **Before committing**: Review all modified files
- **After splitting files**: Review all affected files and references
- **Periodic audits**: Comprehensive review of educational content folders
- **After major changes**: Full review of affected sections

### Review Documentation

**Always document review findings**:
