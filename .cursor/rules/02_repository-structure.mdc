## 🧭 Repository Context

**System Design in Practice** is a comprehensive guide to system design, focusing on real-world architectural decisions, trade-offs, and scalability patterns. It provides:

- Core system design principles
- Common architectural patterns
- Building blocks of distributed systems
- End-to-end system design case studies
- Diagrams (C4, sequence, flow)
- Trade-offs and failure scenarios

**Target Audience**:

- Software Engineers preparing for system design interviews
- Senior engineers transitioning to architect roles
- Engineers designing scalable systems in production

**Purpose**: Provides a practical, interview-ready guide to system design with real-world case studies, architectural patterns, and scalability considerations.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Repository Purpose

**This repository (`system-design-in-practice`) contains:**

- ✅ **Educational Content**: System design principles, patterns, and building blocks (`src/01_introduction/` through `src/08_failures/`)
- ✅ **Case Studies**: End-to-end system design case studies (`src/07_case-studies/`)
- ✅ **References**: Learning resources (books, papers, tools) (`src/references/`)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Roadmap and learning path (`docs/01_road-map.md`)

### 📋 Content Type Classifications

**Educational Content** (`src/01_introduction/`, `src/02_interview-prep/`, `src/03_foundations/`, `src/04_principles/`, `src/05_building-blocks/`, `src/06_patterns/`, `src/08_failures/`):

- Purpose: Educational learning materials for system design
- YAML Frontmatter: Recommended but not strictly required for placeholder content
- Line Limit: Recommended ≤150 lines (split, don't trim)
- File Naming: Must use numbering (01_, 02_, etc., no 00_)

**Case Studies** (`src/07_case-studies/`):

- Purpose: End-to-end system design case studies
- Structure: Each case study has `requirements.md`, `high-level-design.md`, `low-level-design.md`, `scalability.md`, `trade-offs.md`
- Diagrams: Co-located in `diagrams/` folder within each case study
- File Naming: Standard naming (no numbering required for case study folders)

**References** (`src/references/`):

- Purpose: Learning resources and reference materials
- File Naming: Logical names (books.md, papers.md, tools.md)
- No numbering required (reference materials)
