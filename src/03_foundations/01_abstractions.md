# Abstractions in System Design

## What Are Abstractions?

Abstractions are **simplified models** that hide implementation details while exposing essential functionality. In system design, abstractions help us:

- **Think at the right level**: Focus on what matters, ignore irrelevant details
- **Communicate clearly**: Use common language instead of implementation specifics
- **Design flexibly**: Change implementations without changing interfaces

## Why Abstractions Matter

### Mental Model Simplification

Instead of thinking about:
- Network packets, TCP/IP, routing tables, DNS resolution...

We think about:
- "Service A calls Service B" (RPC abstraction)

This lets us focus on **system behavior** rather than network mechanics.

### Design Flexibility

Abstractions enable:
- **Technology swaps**: Change database without changing application logic
- **Scalability evolution**: Add caching layer without rewriting services
- **Testing**: Mock dependencies using abstraction interfaces

## Common Abstraction Layers

### 1. Network Abstractions

**What it hides**: Network protocols, packet routing, connection management

**What it exposes**: Service-to-service communication (RPC, REST, message queues)

**Example**: 
- Instead of: "Send TCP packet to IP 192.168.1.100 port 8080"
- We say: "Call UserService.getUser(id)"

### 2. Storage Abstractions

**What it hides**: Disk I/O, file systems, data structures

**What it exposes**: Read/write operations (databases, key-value stores, object storage)

**Example**:
- Instead of: "Write bytes to sector 1234 on disk"
- We say: "Save user record to database"

### 3. Compute Abstractions

**What it hides**: CPU scheduling, memory management, process isolation

**What it exposes**: Application execution (containers, serverless, virtual machines)

**Example**:
- Instead of: "Allocate 2GB RAM, create process, schedule on CPU core 3"
- We say: "Deploy service with 2GB memory"

## Trade-offs of Abstraction

### Benefits

- ✅ **Simpler mental models**: Easier to reason about systems
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Change implementations independently
- ✅ **Reusability**: Same abstraction works across contexts
- ✅ **Team collaboration**: Common language for communication

### Costs

- ❌ **Performance overhead**: Abstraction layers add latency
- ❌ **Debugging complexity**: Issues hidden behind abstraction
- ❌ **Learning curve**: Must understand abstraction semantics
- ❌ **Leaky abstractions**: Implementation details sometimes leak through

## Choosing the Right Abstraction Level

### Too Low (Over-Detailed)

Thinking about CPU cache misses when designing API endpoints:
- ❌ Premature optimization
- ❌ Harder to communicate
- ❌ Misses bigger picture

### Too High (Over-Simplified)

Saying "it's just a database" without considering:
- ❌ Consistency guarantees
- ❌ Scaling characteristics
- ❌ Failure modes

### Just Right

Understanding that:
- ✅ Database provides ACID guarantees
- ✅ Can scale with read replicas
- ✅ May have eventual consistency trade-offs

## Key Takeaways

1. **Abstractions simplify** complex systems into manageable models
2. **Choose appropriate level** - not too detailed, not too simple
3. **Understand trade-offs** - abstractions have costs and benefits
4. **Use common abstractions** - leverage industry-standard patterns
5. **Know when to peek** - sometimes need to understand implementation
