# Request Flow and Basic Architecture (Part 2-B)

*Previous: [Request Flow and Basic Architecture (Part 2-A)](./07_request-flow-and-basic-architecture-part2.md)*

## Architectural Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Single Server

Everything runs on one machine:

- Web application
- Database
- Static files

**Use Case**: Prototypes, MVPs, very small scale

### Phase 2: Separated Tiers

Web server and database on separate machines:

- Independent scaling
- Better performance
- Clear separation of concerns

**Use Case**: Growing applications, medium scale

### Phase 3: Multiple Servers

Multiple web servers with load balancer:

- Horizontal scaling
- High availability
- Distributed architecture

**Use Case**: Large-scale applications

## Key Takeaways

1. **Separate Concerns**: Split web and database as you grow
2. **DNS Matters**: Critical for routing and scaling
3. **JSON Standard**: Modern APIs use JSON for data exchange
4. **Plan Evolution**: Design with future separation in mind
5. **Independent Scaling**: Separation enables independent scaling of components
6. **Traffic Sources**: Web and mobile apps have different requirements
