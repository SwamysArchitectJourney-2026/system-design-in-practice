# Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations (Part 2): Common Patterns

## Common Patterns

### Read-Heavy vs Write-Heavy

- **Read-heavy** (10:1 ratio): Focus on caching, read replicas
- **Write-heavy** (1:1 ratio): Focus on write throughput, sharding
- **Balanced**: Consider both read and write paths

### Cache Hit Ratio Impact

If 80% of reads hit cache:
- Cache handles: 80% of reads
- Database handles: 20% of reads + 100% of writes
- **Effective database load reduced by 4x** for reads

### Data Growth Projections

Plan for growth:
- **Year 1**: Baseline
- **Year 2**: 2-3x growth
- **Year 3**: 5-10x growth

Design for 3-5 years, not just current scale.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Round numbers** for quick mental math
2. **Focus on orders of magnitude** - exact numbers less important
3. **Account for growth** - design for 3-5 years
4. **Consider all factors** - storage, bandwidth, compute
5. **Validate assumptions** - check if numbers make sense
