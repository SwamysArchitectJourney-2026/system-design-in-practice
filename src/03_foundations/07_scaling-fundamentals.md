# Scaling Fundamentals (Overview)

This topic is split into two parts to stay within the repository's recommended 150-line learning segment size.

- Part 1 focuses on starting simple, request flow, and when to split tiers.
- Part 2 focuses on database choices, vertical vs horizontal scaling, and evaluation takeaways.

- [Part 2: Database Choices and Scaling Strategies](./07_scaling-fundamentals-part2.md)
