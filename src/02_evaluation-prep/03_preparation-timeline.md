# How Long Does It Take to Prepare for System Design Evaluations?

Preparation time depends on experience, but most engineers need **6–10 focused weeks** to reach confidence.

---

## Recommended Preparation Timeline

### Weeks 1–2: Foundations

- Consistency models
- Failure handling
- Estimation
- C4 diagrams

### Weeks 3–4: Building Blocks

- Databases
- Caches
- Load balancers
- Message queues

### Weeks 5–6: Patterns

- Caching strategies
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breakers
- Event-driven design

### Weeks 7–8: Case Studies

- URL Shortener
- Newsfeed
- Payment system
- Rate limiter

### Weeks 9–10: Mock Evaluations

- Timed practice
- Feedback loops
- Refinement

## Common Timeline Mistake

Spending too much time reading and too little time **explaining designs out loud**.

---

## Key Takeaway

Consistency beats intensity.
Daily short practice is more effective than weekend cramming.
