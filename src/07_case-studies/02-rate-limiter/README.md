# Rate Limiter Case Study

A comprehensive system design case study for building a distributed rate limiting service.

## Key Design Highlights

### Architecture

- **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Consistent rate limiting across multiple service instances
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Token bucket, sliding window, fixed window support
- **Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond rate limit checks
- **High Throughput**: Millions of requests per second
- **Flexible Configuration**: Per-user, per-IP, per-API endpoint rate limits

### Technology Stack

- **Application**: Stateless service instances (Java/Python/.NET)
- **Storage**: Redis for distributed rate limit counters
- **Cache**: In-memory cache for frequently accessed limits
- **Configuration**: Database for rate limit rules and policies
- **Monitoring**: Metrics and logging for observability

### Scale

- **Capacity**: Handle 10M+ requests/second
- **Latency**: <1ms p99 for rate limit checks
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime
- **Storage**: Efficient counter storage with TTL-based cleanup
