# URL Shortener - High-Level Design

## System Architecture Overview

The URL shortening service consists of two main flows:

1. **Shortening Flow**: Convert long URL to short URL
2. **Redirection Flow**: Resolve short URL to long URL and redirect

## Core Components

### 1. Load Balancer

- Distributes incoming requests across multiple service instances
- Ensures high availability and load distribution

### 2. Short URL Service

- **Multiple Instances**: Horizontally scalable service instances
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Generate unique short URL identifiers
  - Store URL mappings (short URL → long URL)
  - Retrieve URL mappings for redirection

### 3. Token Service

- **Purpose**: Generate unique numeric identifiers for short URLs
- **Operation**: Assigns ranges of unique numbers to each service instance
- **Characteristics**:
  - Low-frequency service (called only when service instances need new token ranges)
  - Ensures no collisions between service instances
  - Built on relational database (MySQL) for ACID guarantees

### 4. Database

- **Primary Storage**: Stores short URL to long URL mappings
- **Choice**: Columnar database (Cassandra) for:
  - High write throughput
  - Horizontal scalability
  - Efficient storage of large number of records
- **Alternative**: Sharded relational database (MySQL) can also work

## Request Flows

### Shortening Flow

1. User submits long URL through UI
2. Load balancer routes request to available Short URL Service instance
3. Service instance requests token range from Token Service (if needed)
4. Service generates short URL from token
5. Service stores mapping (short URL → long URL) in database
6. Service returns short URL to user

### Redirection Flow

1. User accesses short URL
2. Load balancer routes request to available Short URL Service instance
3. Service queries database for long URL
4. Service returns HTTP redirect (301/302) to long URL
5. User's browser follows redirect to original URL

## What This System Optimizes For

- ✅ **Read Performance**: 100:1 read-to-write ratio - system optimized for fast redirects
- ✅ **Low Latency Redirects**: Sub-50ms p95 latency for redirect operations (critical for user experience)
- ✅ **High Write Throughput**: Can handle 100M+ URL creations per day
- ✅ **Horizontal Scalability**: All components scale horizontally without single points of failure
- ✅ **Global Distribution**: CDN ensures low latency redirects worldwide

## What This System Does NOT Optimize For

- ❌ **Complex Querying**: No support for complex queries (e.g., "find all URLs created by user X")
- ❌ **URL Analytics in Real-Time**: Analytics are processed asynchronously, not real-time
- ❌ **URL Editing**: Once created, URLs cannot be edited (immutable design for simplicity)
- ❌ **Custom Short URLs**: Users cannot choose their own short URL (ensures uniqueness and simplicity)

## What Breaks First at Scale

1. **Database Write Throughput**: 
   - **Bottleneck**: Cassandra write capacity becomes limiting factor
   - **Trigger**: When write QPS exceeds single Cassandra cluster capacity
   - **Solution**: Shard Cassandra cluster, use multiple token ranges, or move to write-optimized storage

2. **Cache Memory**: 
   - **Bottleneck**: Redis memory limits for hot URLs
   - **Trigger**: When cache size exceeds available memory
   - **Solution**: Implement cache eviction policies (LRU), use distributed cache, or multi-tier caching

3. **Token Service Contention**: 
   - **Bottleneck**: Token Service becomes bottleneck if too many instances request ranges simultaneously
   - **Trigger**: When number of service instances grows very large
   - **Solution**: Pre-allocate larger token ranges, implement token service caching, or use distributed ID generation

## Interviewer Lens

### What Signals Senior-Level Thinking

- ✅ **Token Range Assignment**: Demonstrates understanding of distributed ID generation without single point of failure
- ✅ **Read-Heavy Optimization**: Recognizes 100:1 ratio and optimizes accordingly (CDN, cache, read replicas)
- ✅ **Evolutionary Design**: Shows how system evolves from simple to complex (not over-engineered initially)
- ✅ **Trade-off Awareness**: Understands that simplicity (no URL editing) enables scale
- ✅ **Multi-Layer Caching**: CDN → Redis → Database strategy shows deep performance thinking

### Common Candidate Mistakes

- ❌ **Using Centralized Counter**: Single Redis counter for ID generation (single point of failure, bottleneck)
- ❌ **Over-Engineering Early**: Starting with microservices and complex architecture for small scale
- ❌ **Ignoring Read Optimization**: Not recognizing read-heavy nature and missing CDN/cache opportunities
- ❌ **Complex Query Support**: Trying to support analytics queries on primary database (should be async)
- ❌ **Synchronous Analytics**: Blocking redirect response to send analytics (should be async)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Token Service Instead of Centralized Counter?

**Problem with Centralized Counter (Redis)**:

- Single point of failure
- Performance bottleneck (all instances hit same Redis)
- Difficult to scale beyond single Redis capacity

**Solution: Token Range Assignment**:

- Each service instance gets a range of unique tokens
- Instances generate short URLs independently from their assigned range
- Token Service only called when range is exhausted (low frequency)
- No collisions possible (ranges don't overlap)

### Why Cassandra for Primary Storage?

- **Scale**: Can handle billions of URL mappings
- **Write Performance**: Optimized for high write throughput
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Easy to add more nodes
- **Alternative**: Sharded MySQL also viable but requires more operational complexity
