# URL Shortener Case Study

A comprehensive system design case study for building a scalable URL shortening service (similar to TinyURL, bit.ly).

## Overview

This case study covers the complete design of a URL shortening service that can handle millions of requests per second, with high availability, low latency, and global scale.

## Key Design Highlights

### Architecture

- **Token Range Assignment**: Distributed unique ID generation without single point of failure
- **Horizontal Scaling**: All components scale horizontally
- **Multi-Layer Caching**: CDN + Redis for optimal performance
- **Read-Heavy Optimization**: 100:1 read-to-write ratio handled efficiently

### Technology Stack

- **Application**: Stateless service instances (Java/Python/.NET)
- **Database**: Cassandra for URL mappings, MySQL for token ranges
- **Cache**: Redis for frequently accessed URLs
- **Analytics**: Kafka + Spark Streaming for event processing
- **CDN**: Global edge caching for low latency

### Scale

- **Capacity**: 3.5 trillion unique URLs (7-character short URLs)
- **Traffic**: 100 million writes/day, 10 billion reads/day
- **Storage**: 300 TB over 10 years
- **Performance**: <50ms p95 latency for redirects

## Learning Objectives

After studying this case study, you should be able to:

- Design a scalable URL shortening service
- Choose appropriate databases for different use cases
- Implement distributed unique ID generation
- Design for read-heavy workloads
