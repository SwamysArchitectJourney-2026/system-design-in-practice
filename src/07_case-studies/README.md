## Case Study Structure

Each case study follows this structure:

- `requirements.md` - Functional and non-functional requirements
- `high-level-design.md` - System architecture and component interactions
- `low-level-design.md` - Detailed design of components
- `scalability.md` - Scaling strategies and considerations
- `trade-offs.md` - Design decisions and their trade-offs
- `diagrams/` - Case study specific diagrams
  - `context-diagram.md` - C4 Level 1: System context
  - `container-diagram.md` - C4 Level 2: Container architecture
  - `component-diagram.md` - C4 Level 3: Component details
  - `sequence-diagrams/` - Interaction flows and sequences

**Note**: Diagrams are co-located with each case study for better organization and maintainability. Each case study should have its own `diagrams/` folder containing all diagrams specific to that case study.
