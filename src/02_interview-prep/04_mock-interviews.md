# System Design Mock Evaluations

Mock evaluations are the **fastest way to improve** system design performance.

---

## How to Conduct a Mock Evaluation

- Time-box to 45–60 minutes
- Follow real evaluation structure
- Explain everything verbally
- Capture feedback immediately

---

## Common System Design Questions

- Design a URL shortener
- Design Twitter / Newsfeed
- Design WhatsApp
- Design a rate limiter
- Design a payment system

Focus on **depth**, not variety.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Mock evaluations should assess:

- Requirement clarification
- Architecture clarity
- Trade-off reasoning
- Failure handling
- Communication quality

---

## Practice Strategies

- Repeat the same problem multiple times
- Improve explanation clarity each round
- Simulate interruptions and constraints

---

## Key Takeaway

If you are not doing mock evaluations, you are **under-preparing**.
