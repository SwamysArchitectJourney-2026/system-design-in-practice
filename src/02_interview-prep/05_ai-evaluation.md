# Let AI Evaluate Your System Design Interview Preparation

AI can be a powerful **practice partner**, not a replacement for human judgment.

---

## How AI Can Help

- Simulate interview questions
- Challenge design decisions
- Identify weak areas
- Enforce structured thinking

---

## Effective Ways to Use AI

- Ask AI to act as an interviewer
- Present full designs for critique
- Request alternative approaches
- Practice explaining trade-offs

---

## Limitations of AI Evaluation

- AI cannot fully judge real-world experience
- May miss subtle communication cues
- Should complement, not replace, mocks

---

## Continuous Improvement Loop

1. Design a system
2. Get AI feedback
3. Refine explanation
4. Repeat with constraints

---

## Key Takeaway

Use AI to **increase practice frequency**, not to memorize answers.
