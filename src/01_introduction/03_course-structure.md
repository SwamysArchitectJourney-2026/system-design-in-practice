# Course Structure

This repository follows a **deliberate, progressive learning path** designed to build strong system design intuition and interview readiness.

The structure mirrors how experienced engineers think about systems—from fundamentals to real-world applications.

---

## Learning Path Overview

### 1. Foundations

Core concepts that underpin all system designs:

- Abstractions
- Consistency models
- Failure models
- Back-of-the-envelope estimation
- C4 diagrams

> Without strong foundations, system design becomes memorization instead of reasoning.

---

### 2. Principles

High-level qualities that guide design decisions:

- Availability
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Fault tolerance
- Maintainability
- Security

These principles help evaluate **why one design is better than another**.

---

### 3. Building Blocks

Reusable components found in most large-scale systems:

- Load balancers
- Databases
- Caches
- Message queues
- Object storage
- Search systems

Each building block is studied in isolation before being combined.

---

### 4. Architectural Patterns

Common solutions to recurring design problems:

- Caching patterns
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breakers
- CQRS
- Event-driven architecture

Patterns provide **proven approaches**, not rigid rules.

---

### 5. Case Studies

End-to-end designs of real-world systems:

- Requirements gathering
- Estimation
- High-level and low-level design
- Scalability planning
- Observability and security
- Trade-offs and alternatives

Case studies simulate **real interviews and real production decisions**.

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Read sequentially if learning from scratch
- Jump to case studies if preparing for interviews
- Revisit foundations often—they matter more than you think

> Interview Note:
> In interviews, depth on 2–3 case studies is more valuable than shallow
> familiarity with many systems. Use this structure to go deep.

## Key Takeaway

This repository is designed to teach **how to think**, not just **what to build**.
