# Introduction

This section sets the foundation for the entire **System Design in Practice** repository.

Before diving into architectures, patterns, and case studies, it is essential to understand:

- What modern system design really means
- Why it matters for your career
- How this repository is structured

These documents establish the **mental model** used throughout the rest of the content.

## How This Section Can Help in Interviews

Interviewers expect candidates to:

- Think at a system level
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- Reason under constraints

This section ensures you approach every later topic with the **right perspective**.

This perspective ensures you approach every design problem as a decision-making exercise rather than a diagramming task.

## Final Note

System design is not about having the “right answer.”
It is about demonstrating **clear thinking, sound judgment, and practical experience**.

This repository is built to help you do exactly that.
