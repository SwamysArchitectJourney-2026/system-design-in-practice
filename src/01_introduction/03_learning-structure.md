# Learning Structure

I’m using this repository as a **structured record of my learning journey in system design**.

The structure exists to support **how I build intuition over time**—from fundamentals to real-world applications—while keeping the material easy to revisit and refine.

---

## Learning Path Overview

### 1. Foundations

Core concepts that underpin all system designs:

- Abstractions
- Consistency models
- Failure models
- Back-of-the-envelope estimation
- C4 diagrams

> Without strong foundations, system design becomes memorization instead of reasoning.

---

### 2. Principles

High-level qualities that guide design decisions:

- Availability
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Fault tolerance
- Maintainability
- Security

These principles help me evaluate **why one design is better than another**.

---

### 3. Building Blocks

Reusable components found in most large-scale systems:

- Load balancers
- Databases
- Caches
- Message queues
- Object storage
- Search systems

I study each building block in isolation before combining them.

---

### 4. Architectural Patterns

Common solutions to recurring design problems:

- Caching patterns
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breakers
- CQRS
- Event-driven architecture

Patterns provide **proven approaches**, not rigid rules.

---

### 5. Case Studies

End-to-end designs of real-world systems:

- Requirements gathering
- Estimation
- High-level and low-level design
- Scalability planning
- Observability and security
- Trade-offs and alternatives

Case studies help me practice **reasoning end-to-end**, similar to real evaluations and real production decisions.

---

## How I Use This Repository

- Read sequentially when I’m learning a new area from scratch
- Jump to case studies when I want end-to-end practice
- Revisit foundations often—they matter more than I expect

> Personal note:
> For evaluations, I find depth on 2–3 case studies more valuable than shallow familiarity with many systems.

---

## Key Takeaway

I’m using this repository to train myself to think about systems—trade-offs, constraints, and failure modes—not just to draw diagrams.
