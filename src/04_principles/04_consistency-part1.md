# Consistency in System Design

## What Is Consistency?

Consistency ensures that **all nodes in a distributed system see the same data at the same time** (or eventually). It's a fundamental principle that affects system design, performance, and availability.

## Consistency as a Design Principle

### Why Consistency Matters

Consistency is not just a technical requirement—it's a **design decision** that impacts:

- **User Experience**: Users expect to see their changes immediately
- **Data Integrity**: Critical systems must prevent data corruption
- **System Performance**: Strong consistency often requires trade-offs
- **Availability**: Consistency choices affect system uptime

## Types of Consistency Guarantees

### Strong Consistency

**Definition**: All nodes see updates immediately and in the same order.

**When to Use**:
- Financial transactions
- Critical data (medical records, legal documents)
- Systems where correctness is paramount

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Data always correct
- ❌ Higher latency (must wait for all replicas)
- ❌ Lower availability (can't serve if replicas are down)

### Eventual Consistency

**Definition**: All nodes will eventually see the same data, but not immediately.

**When to Use**:
- Social media posts
- User profiles
- Non-critical data
- High-scale systems

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ High availability
- ✅ Low latency
- ❌ Temporary inconsistencies possible
- ❌ Stale reads possible

## Consistency in Practice

### Read-Your-Writes Consistency

**Requirement**: After writing, subsequent reads must see your write.

**Implementation**:
- Route reads to same replica that handled write
- Use session affinity
- Strong consistency for user's own data

**Example**: After posting a comment, you should immediately see it.

### Monotonic Reads

**Requirement**: Once you read a value, you never see an older value.

**Implementation**:
- Route all reads for a user to the same replica
- Use version numbers
- Sticky sessions

**Example**: Reading your account balance should never show a lower amount.

### Causal Consistency

**Requirement**: Causally related updates are seen in order.

**Implementation**:
- Track causal dependencies
- Vector clocks
- Dependency graphs

**Example**: Replies must appear after the original post.

## Consistency vs Other Principles

### Consistency vs Availability

**CAP Theorem**: Can't have all three (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance).

**CP Systems**: Choose consistency over availability
- Financial systems
- Critical databases
- Data integrity paramount

**AP Systems**: Choose availability over consistency
- Social media
- Content delivery
- User experience paramount

### Consistency vs Performance

**Strong Consistency**:
- Requires coordination between nodes
- Higher latency
- Lower throughput

**Eventual Consistency**:
- No coordination needed
- Lower latency
- Higher throughput
