# Maintainability (Part 2): Technical Debt and Best Practices

## Technical Debt Management

### What Is Technical Debt?

**Definition**: Shortcuts taken for speed that need to be paid back later.

**Types**:
- **Code debt**: Quick hacks, poor structure
- **Architecture debt**: Suboptimal design decisions
- **Documentation debt**: Missing or outdated docs
- **Test debt**: Insufficient test coverage

### Managing Technical Debt

**Strategy 1: Track Debt**
- Document known issues
- Prioritize by impact
- Schedule time for cleanup

**Strategy 2: Pay Down Debt**
- Allocate time regularly (e.g., 20% of sprint)
- Refactor incrementally
- Don't let it accumulate

**Strategy 3: Prevent New Debt**
- Code reviews
- Architecture reviews
- Set quality standards

## Documentation Best Practices

### Architecture Documentation

**Include**:
- System overview
- Component diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- Technology choices and rationale
- Deployment architecture

**Keep Updated**: Update docs when architecture changes.

### API Documentation

**Include**:
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes
- Examples

**Tools**: OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman collections.

### Runbooks

**Include**:
- Common operations
- Troubleshooting steps
- Recovery procedures
- Escalation paths

**Purpose**: Enable anyone to operate the system.

## Testing for Maintainability

### Test Coverage

**Aim for**:
- High coverage of critical paths
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end tests for key flows

**Balance**: 100% coverage isn't always necessary, focus on important paths.

### Test Quality

**Good Tests**:
- Fast (run in seconds)
- Independent (no dependencies)
- Repeatable (same results)
- Clear (easy to understand)

**Bad Tests**:
- Slow (minutes to run)
- Flaky (unpredictable)
- Complex (hard to understand)
- Brittle (break on minor changes)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Manage technical debt** - track, prioritize, pay down
2. **Document thoroughly** - architecture, APIs, operations
3. **Test comprehensively** - but focus on what matters
4. **Refactor regularly** - don't let code rot
5. **Balance** - maintainability vs speed to market
