# Reliability (Part 2): Testing, Monitoring, and Recovery

## Testing for Reliability

### Unit Testing

**Focus**: Test individual components in isolation.

**Coverage**:
- Input validation
- Business logic correctness
- Error handling paths

**Example**: Test that password hashing always produces same hash for same input.

### Integration Testing

**Focus**: Test interactions between components.

**Coverage**:
- Service-to-service communication
- Database transactions
- Cache consistency

**Example**: Test that user creation updates both database and cache correctly.

### Chaos Engineering

**Concept**: Intentionally inject failures to test system resilience.

**Techniques**:
- Kill random services
- Inject network delays
- Simulate database failures
- Trigger resource exhaustion

**Benefits**:
- Discover hidden failure modes
- Validate recovery mechanisms
- Build confidence in production

## Monitoring for Reliability

### Key Metrics

**Error Rate**:
- Track percentage of failed requests
- Alert if exceeds threshold (e.g., >0.1%)

**Latency**:
- Monitor p50, p95, p99 latencies
- Detect performance degradation

**Throughput**:
- Track requests per second
- Identify capacity limits

### Alerting Strategy

**Critical Alerts**:
- Error rate > 1%
- Latency p99 > 1 second
- Service unavailable

**Warning Alerts**:
- Error rate > 0.1%
- Latency p95 > 500ms
- Resource utilization > 80%

### Logging Best Practices

- **Structured logging**: JSON format for parsing
- **Log levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- **Context**: Include request ID, user ID, timestamps
- **Sensitive data**: Never log passwords, tokens, PII

## Error Recovery Mechanisms

### Automatic Recovery

**Self-Healing Systems**:
- Automatic restarts on crashes
- Health check-based recovery
- Circuit breaker auto-reset

**Example**: Container orchestrator restarts failed pods automatically.

### Manual Recovery

**Runbooks**:
- Documented recovery procedures
- Step-by-step instructions
- Rollback procedures

**Example**: Database corruption → restore from backup → verify data integrity.

### Data Recovery

**Backup Strategies**:
- Regular backups (daily, hourly)
- Point-in-time recovery
- Geographic redundancy

**Testing**: Regularly test backup restoration to ensure it works.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Test thoroughly** - unit, integration, and chaos testing
2. **Monitor continuously** - track error rates, latency, throughput
3. **Alert appropriately** - critical vs warning thresholds
4. **Recover automatically** - when possible, self-healing
5. **Document recovery** - runbooks for manual intervention
