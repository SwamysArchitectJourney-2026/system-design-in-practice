# Scalability in System Design (Part 2)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start simple**: Begin with vertical scaling, evolve to horizontal
2. **Design for growth**: Plan architecture evolution path
3. **Stateless is key**: Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
4. **Consider trade-offs**: Each scaling approach has costs and benefits
5. **Think incrementally**: Scale in phases, not all at once
