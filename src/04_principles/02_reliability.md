# Reliability in System Design

## What Is Reliability?

Reliability measures **how correctly a system performs its intended function** when it's running. A reliable system:
- Produces correct results
- Handles errors gracefully
- Maintains data integrity
- Behaves predictably

## Availability vs Reliability

### Availability
- **Focus**: Is the system running?
- **Metric**: Uptime percentage
- **Question**: "Can users access the system?"

### Reliability
- **Focus**: Does the system work correctly?
- **Metric**: Error rate, correctness
- **Question**: "Does the system produce correct results?"

### Example

**High Availability, Low Reliability**:
- System is always up (99.99% availability)
- But returns incorrect data 10% of the time
- Users can access it, but results are wrong

**High Reliability, Low Availability**:
- System always returns correct results when running
- But crashes frequently (90% availability)
- When it works, it's perfect, but often unavailable

**Ideal**: High availability AND high reliability.

## Reliability Metrics

### Error Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of requests that result in errors.

```
Error Rate = (Failed Requests / Total Requests) × 100%
```

**Target**: < 0.1% for most systems

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

**Definition**: Average time between system failures.

**Example**: If system fails 4 times per year:
- MTBF = 365 days / 4 = 91.25 days

### Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)

**Definition**: Average time to recover from a failure.

**Example**: If failures take 1 hour to fix on average:
- MTTR = 1 hour

### Reliability Formula

```
Reliability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
```

Higher MTBF and lower MTTR = higher reliability.

## Design Patterns for Reliability

### Pattern 1: Input Validation

**Concept**: Validate all inputs before processing.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents invalid data from causing errors
- Early failure detection
- Clear error messages

**Example**: Validate email format, check required fields, verify data types.

### Pattern 2: Idempotency

**Concept**: Operations can be safely retried without side effects.

**Benefits**:
- Safe retry on failures
- Prevents duplicate processing
- Handles network retries gracefully

**Example**: Payment processing with idempotency keys.

### Pattern 3: Transaction Management

**Concept**: Ensure operations either fully succeed or fully fail.

**Benefits**:
- Data consistency
- Prevents partial updates
- Atomic operations

**Example**: Database transactions, two-phase commits.

### Pattern 4: Error Handling

**Concept**: Gracefully handle and recover from errors.

**Strategies**:
- **Retry**: Transient errors
- **Circuit Breaker**: Repeated failures
- **Fallback**: Alternative behavior
- **Logging**: Track for analysis
