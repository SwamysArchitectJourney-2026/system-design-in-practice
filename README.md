# System Design in Practice

This repository is a practical guide to system design, focusing on real-world architectural decisions, trade-offs, and scalability patterns.

## What This Repository Covers

- Core system design principles
- Common architectural patterns
- Building blocks of distributed systems
- End-to-end system design case studies
- Diagrams (C4, sequence, flow)
- Trade-offs and failure scenarios

## Who This Is For

- Software Engineers preparing for system design interviews
- Senior engineers transitioning to architect roles
- Engineers designing scalable systems in production

## Philosophy

Design is about **trade-offs**, not perfect solutions.
