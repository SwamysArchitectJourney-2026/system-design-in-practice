# System Design in Practice

This repository documents **my personal learning journey in system design** — the concepts I’m studying, the mental models I’m building, and how my thinking evolves over time.

It is **not a course**, not a certification guide, and not a step-by-step tutorial. The structure exists to support *my thinking*, not to prescribe how others must learn.

This repository will evolve as my understanding deepens.

## What This Repository Covers

- Core system design principles
- Common architectural patterns
- Building blocks of distributed systems
- End-to-end system design case studies
- Diagrams (C4, sequence, flow)
- Trade-offs and failure scenarios

## Who This Is For

- Software Engineers preparing for system design interviews
- Senior engineers transitioning to architect roles
- Engineers designing scalable systems in production

## Philosophy

Design is about **trade-offs**, not perfect solutions.

## Repository Structure

> **📋 Single Source of Truth**: The complete and up-to-date repository structure is maintained in [`docs/02_repository-structure.md`](docs/02_repository-structure.md). This file contains the authoritative structure with all file names, conventions, and organization details.

**For the complete repository structure**, see: **[docs/02_repository-structure.md](docs/02_repository-structure.md)**

**Quick Overview**:

- `src/01_introduction/` - Getting started with system design
- `src/02_interview-prep/` - Interview preparation strategies
- `src/03_foundations/` - Foundational concepts (abstractions, consistency, failures, C4 diagrams)
- `src/04_principles/` - System design principles (availability, scalability, etc.)
- `src/05_building-blocks/` - Core building blocks (DNS, load balancers, databases, etc.)
- `src/06_patterns/` - Architectural patterns (caching, rate limiting, CQRS, etc.)
- `src/07_case-studies/` - End-to-end case studies (URL Shortener, YouTube, Twitter, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Review the [01_road-map.md](docs/01_road-map.md) to understand the learning path
2. Check [src/CONTENT_INDEX.md](src/CONTENT_INDEX.md) for a complete topic index
3. Start with **src/01_introduction/** for an overview
4. Review **src/02_interview-prep/** if preparing for interviews
5. Study **src/03_foundations/** for fundamental concepts
6. Explore **src/04_principles/** for system design principles
7. Learn **src/05_building-blocks/** to understand core components
8. Study **src/07_case-studies/** for end-to-end system designs
9. Review **src/08_failures/** to learn from real-world incidents

## Why This Learning Journey Is Public

I believe learning becomes clearer when ideas are written down, structured, and revisited.
Making this repository public helps me:

- Hold myself accountable
- Refine my thinking through clarity
- Share mental models with others on a similar path

Others are welcome to read along, but this repository primarily reflects *my* journey.
